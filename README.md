# FormBot - Automated Form Data Transfer

A Next.js application that provides an intelligent bot to automatically capture form data from one website and transfer it to another website.

## Features

- ðŸ¤– **Smart Form Monitoring**: Automatically detects when forms are filled and submitted
- âš¡ **Instant Data Transfer**: Captures form data and instantly fills the same information on destination site
- ðŸŽ¯ **Accurate Field Mapping**: Intelligently maps form fields between different websites
- ðŸš€ **One-Click Operation**: Simple interface with start/stop controls
- ðŸ“± **Responsive Design**: Beautiful UI that works on all devices

## How It Works

1. **Monitor**: Bot watches the source website for form submissions
2. **Capture**: Automatically captures all form data when submitted
3. **Transfer**: Fills and submits the same data on destination website

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Usage

1. Click the "ðŸš€ Start Form Bot" button
2. The bot will open the source website in a new tab
